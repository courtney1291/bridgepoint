1. Abstract
-----------
In this section, give a summary of the design that this note aims to
describe.

3. Background
-------------
In this section, outline the important points relating to this issue/bug that
the reader would need to know in order to understand the rest of this
document. Here is an example reference to the Document References section [[2.1]](#2.1)

4. Requirements
---------------
[[2.1]](#2.1)

4.1 Migration guide for single domain import flow.  
4.1.1 This informative document explains HOWTO convert an existing MASL model into an xtUML model. It explains the flow of migrating data from a model expressed as MASL into BridgePoint. The required tools and steps are listed.

4.2 MASL project conversion guide: System level modeling flow <br>
4.2.1 xtUML provides a graphical UML approach to multi-domain systems. Wiring of domains together as components through interfaces and using shared data types is supported. This guide explains the steps needed to convert a MASL system model into an xtUML system model.

4.3 Integrate MASL reference manual into Bridgepoint Help
4.3.1 

4.4 Guide for xtUML export to MASL
4.4.1 

5. Analysis
-----------
This section is only required if there is no preceding analysis note. If present
it sets out a brief analysis of the problem to be resolved by this design note. Here is an example reference to the Document References section [[2.1]](#2.1)

5.1 Item 1  
5.1.1 Example sub-item
* Example List Element

5.2 Item 2  
5.2.1 Example sub-item
* Example List Element

6. Design
---------
In this section, describe in detail each step of the Work Required section of
the analysis, how the task will be accomplished, what technologies will
be used, algorithms, etc. Here is an example reference to the Document References section [[2.1]](#2.1)

6.1 Item 1  
```java
    // java code example
    public void clearDatabase(IProgressMonitor pm) 
    {
        // clear the corresponding graphics-root's database
        OoaofgraphicsUtil.clearGraphicsDatabase(rootId, pm);

        Ooaofooa.getDefaultInstance().fireModelElementUnloaded(this);
    }
```
6.1.1 Example sub-item
* Example List Element

6.2 Item 2  
6.2.1 Example sub-item
* Example List Element

7. Design Comments
------------------
If research carried out during this phase shows that a requirement stated in the
analysis note is infeasible or needs some modification, enumerate those changes
here. If there was no preceding analysis note, then this section documents any
deviations from the design as presented at the design review. Here is an example reference to the Document References section [[2.1]](#2.1)

7.1 Item 1  
7.1.1 Example sub-item
* Example List Element

7.2 Item 2  
7.2.1 Example sub-item
* Example List Element

8. Unit Test
------------
Outline all the unit tests that need to pass and describe the method that you
will use to design and perform the tests. Here is an example reference to the Document References section [[2.1]](#2.1)

8.1 Item 1  
8.1.1 Example sub-item
* Example List Element

8.2 Item 2  
8.2.1 Example sub-item
* Example List Element
